Drive Testing Script
This repository contains a script for automating drive testing using the 'smartctl' command. The script allows you to perform long tests on multiple drives simultaneously, log the results, and identify any failures.

Features
Initiates long tests for a list of drives in parallel.
Monitors the progress of the tests and waits for them to complete.
Checks the results of each test and identifies failed drives.
Logs the output to a designated log file.
Displays a summary of the test results, including SMART health status and error logs.
Requirements
To use this script, you need to have the following:

Linux-based operating system
'smartctl' command installed (usually available through 'smartmontools' package)
Usage
Clone the repository or download the script file.
Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Modify the list of drives in the script according to your requirements.
Run the script using the following command:
bash drivetest.sh

Monitor the progress and wait for the tests to complete.
Once the tests finish, check the log file for the detailed results at '/var/log/drivetest.log'.
If any drive fails the test, a file named 'failed_drive.txt' will be created in your home directory.
Notes
Ensure that you have proper permissions to execute the script and access the log files.
Remember to review the log file for the complete results and any identified failures.
Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting pull requests or suggesting improvements.

Disclaimer: Use this script at your own risk. Always backup your important data before performing any drive tests.
